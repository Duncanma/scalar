# OpenAPI Specification Schemas

This directory contains schemas for working with OpenAPI Specification (OAS).

See: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md

## Guidelines

1. **Standard Compliance**
   - All schemas closely follow the latest OpenAPI Specification
   - We maintain strict compatibility with OAS standards

2. **Minimal Extensions**
   - We keep custom extensions to a minimum
   - Only essential modifications are made to support client-side functionality
   - Any extension should live in its own file

3. **Data Organization**
   - References are maintained using unique identifiers (UIDs)
   - Every schema must have testes
